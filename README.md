# threshold_simulations

This a significant refactoring of my Julia codebase that I used in,
_Techniques for Blocking the Propagation of Two Simultaneous Contagions over Networks Using the Graph Dynamical Systems Framework_,
 which is still under consideration. The blocking methods and the diffusion model in the julia_version/ folder can handle an arbitrary number
 of contagions as well as interaction.
